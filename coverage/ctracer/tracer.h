We use normal Python objects as keys for writing into the file_data
dictionaries.

This ends up creating the same duplicate objects over and over again inside the
hot loop of the trace function, which is not ideal!

In order to avoid that, we intern our keys global to the tracer. This means
that in the common case where the tracer has already seen the key somewhere we
don't need to allocate a new one. This can significantly speed up tracing.
